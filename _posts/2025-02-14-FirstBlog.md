# Post 1
I need somewhere to kep track of all of my projects, therefore i have started a blog using github pages.

I have chosen to use github pages as:
- It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which allows for simple blog posts using markdown formatting and support for jekyll themes.
- I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my note taking app, which also uses markdown formatting, meaning I can insert my notes with all the correct formatting.
- I can easily upgrade the blog by uploading the posts as markdown files if I want to upgrade in the future.
- It is free to use.
- It will help me to develop my skills in git and github.
